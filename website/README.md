## File Structure

```
collaborative-editor/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # JavaScript functionality

## How It Works

- **Frontend Only**: This is a client-side application that simulates real-time collaboration
- **Local Storage**: Documents are saved to browser's localStorage
- **Simulated Collaboration**: The app simulates other users joining and typing
- **Rich Text**: Uses browser's contentEditable API for rich text editing

## Browser Support

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Customization

You can customize the editor by modifying:
- `styles.css` - Change colors, fonts, and layout
- `script.js` - Add new features or modify existing ones
- `index.html` - Update the structure and content

## Future Enhancements

To make this a fully functional collaborative editor, you would need:
- Backend server (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- WebSocket server for real-time communication
- Database for document storage
- User authentication system
